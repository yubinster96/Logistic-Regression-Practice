# Logistic-Regression-Practice
Practicing Logistic Regression on Cancer variables

Libraries used: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot

used a dataset called data(1)(dataset for logistic).csv 

dropped diagnosis as it will be our y variable output and used rest to visualize on a heat map using seaborn

also made sure no null values (don't want errors later on)

for this particular example, I used just the variables with "worst" in the variable name

trained and tested and used a logistic regression model

printed out a classification report at the end as well as confusion matrix as in these specific medical cases, easily being able to visualize a confusion matrix that has
the true positives, false positives, true negative and false negative give a clear understanding on how good the model is. we want to reduce false negative as much as possible here.
